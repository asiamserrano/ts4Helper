&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Base Game Compatible!Hey guys! I know a lot of you have been asking for some custom baby/toddler food for awhile. The reason why I&#x27;ve been putting it off is because they are my least favorite age groups to play lol (I just age them up 🙊)!! But you guys have waited too long so I hope you guys will like this.Why is it not custom recipes?It&#x27;s because the infant food is not an actual recipe that can be modified, or at least I don&#x27;t know how to do it 😅. The only way I came up with is just to override the EA infant food.Terms of Use Please be respectful and do not release my early access content.

I know a lot of you have been asking for some custom baby/toddler food for awhile. The reason why I've been putting it off is because they are my least favorite age groups to play lol (I just age them up 🙊)!! But you guys have waited too long so I hope you guys will like this.</p><p><em>Why is it not custom recipes?</em><br />It's because the infant food is not an actual recipe that can be modified, or at least I don't know how to do it 😅. The only way I came up with is just to override the EA infant food.</p><p><strong>Terms of Use</strong></p><ul> <li><strong>Please be respectful and do not release my early access content.</strong></li> <li>Please do not include my items in Mod folders, uploaded builds etc. Link back to my Patreon page for others to download separately</li> <li>Please do not recolor, convert, and/or edit my meshes</li></ul><p><strong>HOW TO USE:</strong></p><p>1.
