&quot;description&quot;: &quot;Everyone loves a good nail set, and I’m not an exception to the rule.  You like it long? I gotcha. You prefer it office friendly? I also got  you covered. All the nail shapes sans the toe nails come in 2 finishes -  matte and glossy. Make it shiny or keep it casual, the choice is yours.  Plus, you will have 35 vibrant colour options to choose from so you  could match your little claws with any possible outfit. Enjoy and happy simming 💅 BGC standalone 35 swatches not allowed for random custom thumbnail PSDs can be found HERE my TOUMirror Link - SFSupd 04\\01\\2023 - updated meshes, textures, added new colours, please remove the old files&quot;,

You like it long? I gotcha. You prefer it office friendly? I also got  you covered. All the nail shapes sans the toe nails come in 2 finishes -  matte and glossy. Make it shiny or keep it casual, the choice is yours.  Plus, you will have 35 vibrant colour options to choose from so you  could match your little claws with any possible outfit. Enjoy and happy simming 💅</p><ul> <li>BGC</li> <li>standalone</li> <li>35 swatches</li> <li>not allowed for random</li> <li>custom thumbnail</li> <li><a
